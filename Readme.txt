2.	Describe the boundaries in this problem.
    In this problem, there are four variables.
    Let's say it as x1, x2, x3, x4;

    Bundaries can be described as following equation.

    x1 = 0; x1 = 100;
    x2 = 0; x2 = 100;
    x3 = 0; x3 = 100;
    x4 = 0; x4 = 100;

    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 0;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 59.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 62.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 66.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 69.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 72.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 76.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 79.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 82.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 86.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 89.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 92.5;
    0.1x1 + 0.1x2 + 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 = 100;

3.	Present one example to demonstrate the normal values of this problem.
    30,   30,   30,   30:   F
    61.5,   61.5,   61.5,   61.5:   D-
    65,   65,   65,   65:   D
    68.5,   68.5,   68.5,   68.5:   D+
    71.5,   71.5,   71.5,   71.5:   C-
    75,   75,   75,   75:   C
    78.5,   78.5,   78.5,   78.5:   C+
    81.5,   81.5,   81.5,   81.5:   B-
    85,   85,   85,   85:   B
    88.5,   88.5,   88.5,   88.5:   B+
    91.5,   91.5,   91.5,   91.5:   A-
    96.5,   96.5,   96.5,   96.5:   A

4.	Present one example to illustrate the “abnormal” values.
    -0.05,   0,   0,   0
    0,   -0.05,   0,   0
    0,   0,   -0.05,   0
    0,   0,   0,   -0.05
    100.05,   100,   100,   100
    100,   100.05,   100,   100
    100,   100,   100.05,   100
    100,   100,   100,   100.05

5.	Present one example to illustrate the concept of “equivalent classes”.
    f1 = [30,   30,   30,   30]   F
    f2 = [40,   40,   40,   40]   F

    Above two elements f1, f2  are belong to same classes "F". In this case, two element have equivalent relation.

    a1 = [95,   95,   95,   95]   A
    a2 = [97,   97,   97,   97]   A

    Above two elements a1, a2  are belong to same classes "A". In this case, two element have equivalent relation.
